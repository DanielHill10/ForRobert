Hi Daniel,

I have some ideas for ways that we can expand this simple game.  
I have sketched them out below, we probably won't end up with world of Warcraft, but we should end up with something playable.

1) Team Class to manage team members
2) AreAllAlive should be moved to new team class
3) TeamHit method should be moved to the new class

4) New GameBoardClass to track position of team members
5) Game Board should have spawn points for Teams.
6) When a team is killed a new version of that team should spawn at the spawn point.

7) Teams should randomly patrol the game board.
8) Teams will battle when they are on Adjacent positions in the Gameboard.

9) Simple Graphical representation of the gameboard.
10) Simple Graphical representation of team members.
11) Simple Graphical representation of Attacks

12) Player controlled team!!!
13) Two player controlled team
14) Network interface for two players on two different machines
15) Increase player count.
